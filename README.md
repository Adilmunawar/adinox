## Description

AdiNox is a robust and user-friendly authenticator application designed to provide secure two-factor authentication (2FA) for your online accounts.  It implements the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) and HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithms, offering a reliable alternative to traditional SMS-based authentication.  AdiNox aims to provide a seamless and secure experience, similar to other leading authenticator apps, with a focus on user privacy and control.

This project was created with the goal of providing a secure, open-source authentication solution.  We believe in giving users control over their security and data.

## How it Works

AdiNox works by generating one-time passwords (OTPs) that change either at specific time intervals (TOTP) or after a certain number of uses (HOTP).  These OTPs, in combination with your regular password, provide an extra layer of security, making it much harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts.

1.  **Account Setup:** When you enable 2FA for an online account, the service provides a secret key (often as a QR code).
2.  **Key Storage:** You add this secret key to AdiNox, either by scanning the QR code or entering it manually.
3.  **OTP Generation:** AdiNox uses the secret key and the current time (for TOTP) or a counter (for HOTP) to generate a unique OTP.
4.  **Authentication:** When you log in to the online service, you enter your password and the current OTP displayed by AdiNox.
5.  **Verification:** The online service verifies the OTP, and if it's correct, you're granted access.

## FAQ

**Q: What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?**
A:  2FA is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password but also something that only the user has, like a code from an authenticator app.

**Q:  Is AdiNox secure?**
A:  AdiNox stores your secret keys securely end to end encrypted on your database,which is also secured by multilayer securities

**Q:  How is AdiNox different from Google Authenticator/Authy?**
A:  As we all know Google and all other authenticators mostly works on mobile devices, sometimes we don't have access to our mobile phone so here we have introduced a web authenticator as a solution
