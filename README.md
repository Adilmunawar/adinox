## Description

AdiNox is a robust and user-friendly authenticator application designed to provide secure two-factor authentication (2FA) for your online accounts.  It implements the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) and HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithms, offering a reliable alternative to traditional SMS-based authentication.  AdiNox aims to provide a seamless and secure experience, similar to other leading authenticator apps, with a focus on user privacy and control.

This project was created with the goal of providing a secure, open-source authentication solution.  We believe in giving users control over their security and data.

## Features

AdiNox includes a comprehensive set of features:

* **TOTP and HOTP Support:** Generates time-based (TOTP) and counter-based (HOTP) one-time passwords.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy setup and use.
* **QR Code Scanning:** Quickly add accounts by scanning QR codes.
* **Manual Entry:** Option to manually enter account details (secret key, etc.).
* **Account Management:**
    * Add, edit, and delete accounts.
    * Organize accounts with custom names.
* **Secure Storage:** Securely stores secrets locally.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to work on multiple platforms. (Specify which ones in your main README)
* **Backup and Restore:** (If implemented)  Options to back up and restore your accounts.  Specify details.
* **Dark Mode:** (If implemented) Support for a dark theme for better usability in low-light conditions.
* **Open Source:** The code is open-source, allowing for community review and contribution.
* **Free:** AdiNox is free to use.
* **Localization:** (If implemented) Support for multiple languages.
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find accounts.
* **Biometric Authentication:** (If implemented) Unlock the app using biometrics.

## How it Works

AdiNox works by generating one-time passwords (OTPs) that change either at specific time intervals (TOTP) or after a certain number of uses (HOTP).  These OTPs, in combination with your regular password, provide an extra layer of security, making it much harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts.

1.  **Account Setup:** When you enable 2FA for an online account, the service provides a secret key (often as a QR code).
2.  **Key Storage:** You add this secret key to AdiNox, either by scanning the QR code or entering it manually.
3.  **OTP Generation:** AdiNox uses the secret key and the current time (for TOTP) or a counter (for HOTP) to generate a unique OTP.
4.  **Authentication:** When you log in to the online service, you enter your password and the current OTP displayed by AdiNox.
5.  **Verification:** The online service verifies the OTP, and if it's correct, you're granted access.

## FAQ

**Q: What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?**
A:  2FA is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password but also something that only the user has, like a code from an authenticator app.

**Q:  Is AdiNox secure?**
A:  AdiNox stores your secret keys securely on your device.  (Expand on this with details of your security implementation).

**Q:  What happens if I lose my device?**
A:  (Provide instructions for backup and restore, if available.  Otherwise, advise users to save their secret keys or recovery codes).

**Q:  How is AdiNox different from Google Authenticator/Authy?**
A:   (Explain the differences, focusing on AdiNox's unique features, advantages, or philosophy, e.g., open-source, privacy focus, specific features).
